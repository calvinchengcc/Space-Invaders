Space-Invaders
==============

A classic arcade game involving creepy aliens

#### Objective

After having battled through a number of asteroid fields on your way back to your home planet, you come across one final obstacle: a field of angry aliens! Luckily, a few barriers have been set up by previous space travellers, knowing that this is common space invader territory.

Nonetheless, you will need to kill all of the invaders ahead of you; if even a single alien alerts its mothership of where your home planet is, it could spell disaster your entire race!

Your task will not be easy, however. These aliens occasionally fire alien pods towards you that explode on impact, severely damaging your ship. Moreoever, if an alien ship comes into contact with you... I hope you've said your final goodbyes to your loved ones.

#### Controls

- Arrow keys to move
- 'Space' key to fire missiles

###### Cheats

Too difficult for you? I thought so. Luckily, a few fellow space dwellers have noticed your distress calls, and are willing to help out with a few tricks of their own.
- Press 'F' to upgrade your ship to become indestructible
- Press 'D' for an infinite supply of ammunition
- Press 'S' to have your friends repair the barriers in front of you
- Press 'A' to test out the newest prototype of a zap gun!
